## Build Your Own Lisp

This is my follow-along project for the book [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/). The intent is to learn more C and to get basic understand of Lisp-like languages by implementing a simple Lisp in C. I plan to do all of the bonus exercises and try to make this project a bit more my own as I work through it.
